Hello TA that is marking our sprint 3,

We just wanted to note that 2 members of our group have dropped this course. 
	Harshraj Gohil has not been responsive to us for all of sprint 2 and sprint 3 so we assumed he dropped the course,
	Ziyu Tan told us that he dropped the course.

so we are only 4 members left in this project and we are working hard to finished the requirements for each sprint but it has been a lot of work so we hope
that u can consider our group size when looking at how much work we have gotten done.

Thank you for your time!
