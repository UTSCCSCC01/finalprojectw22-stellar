Our team was organized through piazza and emails where we got to learn about each other. 

After we all agreed to work together, we started brainstorming ideas for our project through discord and we all got a chance to discuss which ideas we liked and didn't like and if our group was split up on a certain idea, we would redo the vote after discussing why each person voted for what they wanted. We used google drive to write down our plan for the project. 

After having our ideas written down we started prioritizing the ideas. Each idea we all voted from level 1 to 3, level 1 being low priority and level 3 being high priority. Usually it took us around 2 to 3 tries of voting to get everyone to agree on one priority per idea. 

So far, we have met about twice a week to get everyone on the same page but we think that we will be meeting a bit more often as we get deeper into this project. We are planning to keep each other updated on everything we work on to minimize miscommunication that can lead to complications.
