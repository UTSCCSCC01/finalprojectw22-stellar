## Difference

Our product is completely online and is intended for quick and casual play. There is no need to make an account to play and it is easy for players to quickly host a game and start playing. 

Our product is better for users who desire customizability in there games when compared with Ubisoft's Jeopardy. Ubisofts version of the game does not allow for custom game boards so users are only able to play the core boards provided by the game. This can lead to the game becoming stall the more you play it as it doesnt allow for much replayabilty. 

We think that Ubisoft decided to go this route since the base game does offer a lot of core content such as a career mode and over 2000 questions. For them to add customs boards they would need to make a board maker, a custom board viewer and a way to filter through the custom boards.
