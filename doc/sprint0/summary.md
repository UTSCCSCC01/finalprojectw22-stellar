## Key Principles

1. Smooth UI and User Experience over content - The design should be appealing and easy to use as to not loss the users interest. Content can always be added later after establishing a strong UX base.
2. Lenience - Allow users to be creative with custom game boards and give more control to the user about game rules. It is a game after all so the main goal should be the users enjoying themselves.
