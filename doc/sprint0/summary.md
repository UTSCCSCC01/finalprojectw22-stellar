## Objective

Build an online version of the hit TV gameshow Jeopardy in the same style as the JackBox Party games. The online version will support custom player made game boards alongside an ingame board browser as well as built in game boards. An account will be needed to share custom boards but not needed to be able to host and play matches. 

## Key Scenarios

1.  Kyle is at a get together with a few friends on the weekend. The party has been going strong for a few hours but it is now starting to die down. Kyle is looking for an chill activity bring finish the night off good while bringing all his friends together. 
2.  Ann is spending Thanksgiving at her parents house where all of her extended family have come to visit. Her uncle's new wife is causing some tension after dinner and she is worried that things will only continue to escalate unless she interferes. Ann wants to find an activity where everyone in the family can participate while also saving Thanksgiving.

## Key Principles

1. Smooth UI and User Experience over content - The design should be appealing and easy to use as to not loss the users interest. Content can always be added later after establishing a strong UX base.
2. Lenience - Allow users to be creative with custom game boards and give more control to the user about game rules. It is a game after all so the main goal should be the users enjoying themselves.
