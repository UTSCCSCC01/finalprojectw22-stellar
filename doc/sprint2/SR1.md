* STEL-5

What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
* Meeting regularly to discuss recent development and any difficulties encountered
* Work cooperatively on documents so all group members are aware of the current state of the project

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
* Discuss weekly schedule beforehand so that no member may miss a meeting if possible
* Set a definite schedule that works with all group members so that the group may valuably utilize time spent during meetings

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
* Having standups on consecutive days instead of providing a day (or longer) gap in between

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1 
* We tried to jump into implementing user stories individually without having a framework for our project app to build off of. This delayed our user stories implementation due to not connecting the essential elements in order for us to implement features.
* This sprint was mostly used to understand how we can work remotely together to implement user stories individually so that future sprints go smoothly.
