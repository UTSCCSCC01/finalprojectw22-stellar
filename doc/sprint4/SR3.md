What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
* Meeting frequently (every other day) to keep everyone updated and the project moving quicker.
* Working together on the documentation of each sprint so that everyone is aware of the current state of the project.

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
* Alert members about a day before the meetup that a meetup will occur so that no one forgets to show up / everyone shows up in a timely manner
* Set a definite schedule that works with all group members so that the group may valuably utilize time spent during meetings
* Creating a meeting agenda before scheduled meeting times so everyone knows what the meeting will be about

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
* Providing even time in between meetups so that everyone has sufficient time to spend on development

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3
* Understanding how the frontend works with the backend helped us understand how we want to implement our core features of the app.
* Working together to solve more complicated components to this project so that the project can progress faster instead of stalling.
* Figuring out how our separately designed features should be hooked up together so the whole game works together instead of having separate features that work alone.
